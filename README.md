Udacity Cloud Developer Nanodegree Program - Project 1
This repository contains project code and documentation for the section entitled "Part 2 Cloud Fundamentals" of the Udacity Cloud Developer Nanodegree Program. 
This project taught how to deploy a static website to AWS using S3, CloudFront, and IAM.  A functional website was provided.
I made minimal changes to the starter code, and deployed to AWS. Deliverables consisted of a link to the website, and screen-grabs 
to show that the website was properly deployed.
